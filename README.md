# DNS Proxy

DNS proxy listens for incoming DNS requests on the local interface and 
resolves remote hosts using an external PHP script, through http proxy requests. 

If you can't use VPN, UDP tunnels or other methods to resolve external names 
in your LAN, DNS proxy is a good and simple solution.

## Building

For debian/ubuntu users:  
`apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev`

then

`make`

## Usage 

```bash
dnsp -l 127.0.0.1 -h 10.0.0.2 -r 8080 -s http://www.andreafabrizi.it/nslookup.php
```
In this case, DNS proxy listens on port 53 (bind on 127.0.0.1) and sends the
requests to external script through the 10.0.0.2:8080 proxy.

**IMPORTANT:** Please, don't use the script hosted on my server, it's only for testing purpose. 
Instead host the nslookup.php script on your own server or use a free hosting services. Thanks!

```bash
 dnsp 0.5
 usage: dnsp -l [local_host] -h [proxy_host] -r [proxy_port] -s [lookup_script]

 OPTIONS:
      -v  	 Enable DEBUG mode
      -p		 Local port
      -l		 Local host
      -r		 Proxy port
      -h		 Proxy host
      -u		 Proxy username (optional)
      -k		 Proxy password (optional)
      -s		 Lookup script URL
      -w   HTTP port
```
## Testing

To test if DNS proxy is working correctly, first run the program as following (replace the placeholders with the correct proxy IP and port!):

```bash
dnsp -l 127.0.0.1 -h x.x.x.x -r nnnn -s http://www.fantuz.net/nslookup.php
```

then, try to resolve an hostname using the **dig** command:

```bash
dig www.google.com @127.0.0.1
```

The result must be something like this:

```
; <<>> DiG 9.8.1-P1 <<>> www.google.com @127.0.0.1
