GOALS OF THE PROJECT:
- conform to D-o-H header specifications given in IETF proposals
  not difficult as DNSP born before !!
	https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https-03
	https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-wireformat-http-01
- implement answers from DNS/API engine: dns.google.com
- add REDIS, test started and looking promising, can be used to cache responses or track usage and distribute DNS blockchain

Post-IETF status:
 - no RAW packet in PHP -> mod library or use NET_DNS2 library !!
 - no base64 urlencode... not an issue (but requires SRV/CLN mods)
 - TTL, fixed :) but need help to do the proper translation HEX/HEX

MINORS:
 - add compression algo choice/type as option (deflate, brotli, gzip ...)
 - remove fixed TTL as is is used just for tests on hex coversion
 - fix NS et MX trimming (depending on PHP version 5/7?)

WORK-IN-PROGRESS:
 - extract validity TTL from Content-Type header in response, supporting H1 and H2. Then pass it to the ready-made structure
 - multiple listener, UDP & TCP, different parsing needed (2 more bytes in/out)
