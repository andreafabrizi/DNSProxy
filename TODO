- conform to D-o-H header specifications given in IETF proposals
  not difficult as DNSP born before !!

- implement answers from DNS/API engine: dns.google.com
- REDIS, this is the main goal so far, test started and looking promising.
  it can be used to cache responses, to track usage and distribute DNS blockchain


IETF status:
 - no RAW packet in PHP -> mod library
 - no base64 urlencode... not an issue (but requires SRV/CLN mods)
 - TTL, fixed :) but need help to do the proper translation HEX/HEX

OTHERS:
 - add compression algo choice/type as option (deflate, brotli, gzip ...)
 - remove fixed TTL as is is used just for tests on hex coversion
 - extract validity TTL from Content-Type header in response, supporting H1 and H2. Then pass it to the ready-made structure
