# Configuration file for Varnish Cache.
#
# /etc/init.d/varnish expects the variables $DAEMON_OPTS, $NFILES and $MEMLOCK
# to be set from this shell script fragment.
#
# Note: If systemd is installed, this file is obsolete and ignored.  You will
# need to copy /lib/systemd/system/varnish.service to /etc/systemd/system/ and
# edit that file.

# Should we start varnishd at boot?  Set to "no" to disable.
START=yes

# Set WARMUP_TIME to force a delay in reload-vcl between vcl.load and vcl.use
# This is useful when backend probe definitions need some time before declaring
# configured backends healthy, to avoid routing traffic to a non-healthy backend.
#WARMUP_TIME=0

# Maximum number of open files (for ulimit -n)
NFILES=131072

# Maximum locked memory size (for ulimit -l)
# Used for locking the shared memory log in memory.  If you increase log size,
# you need to increase this number as well
MEMLOCK=82000
